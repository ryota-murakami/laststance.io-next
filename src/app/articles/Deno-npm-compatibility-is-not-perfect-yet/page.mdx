import { ArticleLayout } from '@/components/ArticleLayout'

export const article = {
  auhtor: 'Ryota Murakami',
  title: 'Deno npm compatibility is not perfect yet.',
  date: '2023-09-02',
  description: "I can't run @clack/prompts on Deno",
}

export const metadata = {
  title: article.title,
  description: article.description,
  openGraph: {
    title: article.title,
    images: [`/api/og?title=${article.title}`],
  },
}

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout article={article} {...props} />

With the recent update allowing the use of npm in Deno, I was inspired to create a script using the CLI application library `@clack/prompts`.\
The idea was to input the blog post title and snippet, and then generate a `.md` template.\
Given that Deno can execute TypeScript directly, I believed it would offer a seamless experience for writing CLI scripts in TypeScript without the need for a build process.

However, I encountered an error: `error: Uncaught Error: Not implemented: net.Socket.prototype.constructor with fd option`, which prevented the script from running in Deno.

In the end, I created a `package.json` file, installed `@clack/prompts` using `pnpm`, and wrote a script in Node to generate the blog template for Deno Fresh.\
The result was a rather chaotic arrangement of project files.
